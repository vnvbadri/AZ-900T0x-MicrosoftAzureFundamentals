# 03 - Deploy Azure Container Instances

In this walkthrough we create, configure, and deploy a Docker container by using Azure Container Instances (ACI) in the Azure Portal. The container is a Welcome to ACI web application that displays a static HTML page. 

# Task 1: Create a container instance

In this task, we will create a new container instance for the web application. 

1. Click on the Azure Portal icon on the VM desktop and login with the Azure credentials from the Lab Environment output page.

2. From the **All services** blade, search for and select **Container instances** and then click **+ New**. 

3. Provide the following Basic details for the new container instance  (leave the defaults for everything else)): 

	| Setting| Value|
	|----|----|
	| Subscription | **Choose your subscription** |
	| Resource group | **myRGContainer-[DeploymentID]** (Use Existing) |
	| Container name| **mycontainer**|
	| Region | **(US) East US** |
	| Image source| **Docker Hub or other registry**|
	| Image type| **Public**|
	| Image| **microsoft/aci-helloworld**|
	| OS type| **Linux** |
	| Size| ***Leave at the default***|
	|||

    **Note** - Deployment ID can be obtained from the Lab Environment output page.

4. Configure the Networking tab (replace **xxxx** with the Deployment ID). Leave all other settings at their default values .

	| Setting| Value|
	|--|--|
	| DNS name label| **mycontainerdnsxxxx** |
	|||
	
	**Note**: Your container will be publicly reachable at dns-name-label.region.azurecontainer.io. If you receive a **DNS name label not available** error message following the deployment, specify a different DNS name label (don't use xxxx) and re-deploy.

5. Click **Review and Create** to start the automatic validation process.

6. Click **Create** to create the container instance. 

7. Monitor the deployment page and the **Notifications** page. 

8. While you wait you may be interested in viewing the [sample code behind this simple application](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/aci-helloworld). Browse the \app folder. 

# Task 2: Verify deployment of the container instance

In this task, we verify that the container instance is running by ensuring that the welcome page displays.

1. After the deployment is complete, click the **Go to resource** link the deployment blade or the link to the resource in the Notification area.

2. On the **Overview** blade of **mycontainer**, ensure your container **Status** is **Running**. 

3. Locate the Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN).

2. Copy the container's FQDN into the URL text box web browser and press **Enter**. The Welcome page should display.

**Note**: You could also use the container IP address in your browser. 

Congratulations! You have used Azure Portal to successfully deploy an application to a container in Azure Container Instance.
